# Reporting Issues

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability within this project, we appreciate your effort in helping us keep it secure by reporting it **responsibly**.

Please **do not create a public GitHub issue** for security-related matters.

Instead, contact the **project leaders directly** at:

ðŸ“§ **anurag.mishra@owasp.org, ravi.mishra@owasp.org**

When reporting, please include:
- A clear description of the vulnerability and its potential impact.
- Steps to reproduce or proof-of-concept (if applicable).
- Any relevant screenshots, logs, or configuration details.
- Suggested fix or mitigation ideas (optional).

## Response Process

Once a vulnerability report is received:
1. Project leaders will acknowledge receipt within **5 business days**.
2. The issue will be reviewed and validated.
3. A fix will be developed, tested, and included in a future release.
4. A public disclosure will be made once the issue is resolved and verified.

We may credit researchers who responsibly report valid vulnerabilities, unless anonymity is requested.

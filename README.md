## 🔍 Overview

The **OWASP Payment Security Testing Guide (PSTG)** aims to establish a standardized framework for assessing the security of digital payment systems, gateways, wallets, and UPI-based platforms.

With the rapid growth of fintech and payment integrations, organizations and developers face unique challenges around **transaction integrity, PCI DSS compliance, fraud prevention**, and **data protection**.

PSTG serves as a **practitioner-focused guide** to help testers, developers, and security teams identify vulnerabilities, design secure payment flows, and validate compliance using structured methodologies.

---

## 💡 Problem Statement

Most application security testing frameworks (like OWASP ASVS or MASVS) do not deeply cover **payment-specific threats** such as transaction replay, refund abuse, payment gateway misconfiguration, or merchant key leakage.

The PSTG fills this gap by offering **step-by-step testing techniques** and **security best practices** tailored specifically for the fintech ecosystem — spanning **cards, UPI, wallets, netbanking, and payment APIs**.

---

## 🚀 Purpose of the Project

To create an open, vendor-neutral, and community-driven guide that helps organizations:

* Secure payment integrations and flows.
* Test digital payment platforms systematically.
* Understand and mitigate payment-specific threats.
* Encourage adoption of security by design in financial applications.

---

## 📦 Project Deliverables

* **A detailed guide** covering:

  * Payment security fundamentals
  * Threat modeling for payment flows
  * Common vulnerabilities and test cases
  * Secure integration practices (UPI, Cards, Netbanking, Wallets, etc.)
  * Automation and continuous validation approaches

* **Reference implementations and examples** for testers and developers.

* **Periodic releases** (PDF/HTML format) available on the OWASP website.

* **CTF-style challenges** (optional) for hands-on learning.
